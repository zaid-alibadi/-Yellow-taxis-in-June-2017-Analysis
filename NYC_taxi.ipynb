    "### Final Observation\n",
    "Comparing taking rides from an airport zone (JFK and LaGuardia) with Manhattan\n",
    "airports ride are more rewarding (tips and amounts) but take longer time to finish\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Based on the above observation, my proposed plan as a taxi driver working 10 hours a week:\n",
    "\n",
    "on weekdays (Monday, Thursday, and Friday): work in Manhattan (Midtown center + Upper East Side South) from 3am-5am\n",
    "then head to the airport area (ex. LaGuardia) and work from 1pm-3pm\n",
    "\n",
    "on weekend (Sunday): work in Upper East Side South from 5am-6am and in Upper East Side South from 6am-7am\n",
    "and if i want more hours, I will head to the LaGuardia airport after 7pm to work couple hours\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Reasoning behind this plan:\n",
    "- avoiding the busiest hours (more taxi on the street) and focusing on the hours where there are less taxi and therefore people are willing to tips more while also driving in less Crowded streets\n",
    "\n",
    "- following this plan will result in covering both the Manhattan and airports zones in the most rewarding hours (more tips and total amount). Also, by diversifying working in both zone, I will take the advandage of the more rewarding but yet longest dutation trip from the airports\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions:\n",
    "- JFK airport data follow the same trends as LaGuardia airport data\n",
    "- Since we only used June 2017 data, we are assuming other months following the same trends\n",
    "- Since the total amount of each trip will be calucalte based on a system (duration and length of a trip), we used the tips amount as a measurement of a zone riders' generosity. Which we consider as an extra profit of a trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible ways to enrich this dataset\n",
    "- add whether data to see if rain/snow/temp have an effect\n",
    "- add the excat location of the pick up (longitude and latitude) and then applying some clustering algorithm to see if you could find clusters of more details areas than the PULOCATION zones. Then, we following the same approach to identified a more exact location to work in.\n",
    "- Identify the days of holiday/celebrations or sport/social events and thier locations in NYC and see if there they affects the amount/tips of trips\n"
